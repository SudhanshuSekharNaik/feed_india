# Feed India 🍽️🇮🇳 - Bridging the Gap Between Food Waste and Hunger
## 🌟 The Problem: India's Food Paradox

India faces a critical paradox that demands immediate attention:

### 📊 The Harsh Reality

**Food Wastage Crisis:**
- India wastes approximately **67 million tonnes** of food every year
- This wasted food is worth nearly **₹92,000 crores** annually
- Enough to feed **100 million people** for an entire year

**Hunger Scarcity Crisis:**
- India ranks **107th out of 121 countries** in the Global Hunger Index
- Over **190 million people** go to bed hungry every night
- **14% of India's population** is undernourished
- **35% of children** under 5 suffer from stunting due to malnutrition

## 🎯 Our Mission

**Feed India** was born from a simple yet powerful vision: **"What if we could redirect the food that's being wasted to those who need it the most?"**

This project is my personal initiative to create a technological bridge between surplus food and empty stomachs, addressing both sides of India's food crisis simultaneously.

## 💡 The Solution

Feed India is a comprehensive platform that:

### 🚚 For Food Donors (Restaurants, Hotels, Caterers, Individuals)
- Provides easy channels to notify about surplus food
- Connects with verified NGOs and distribution networks
- Ensures food reaches those in need efficiently

### 🏠 For NGOs & Shelters
- Creates a reliable pipeline of food donations
- Reduces operational costs of sourcing meals
- Expands their capacity to serve more people

### 🌱 Environmental Impact
- Reduces methane emissions from food decomposing in landfills
- Lowers the carbon footprint of food production
- Promotes sustainable consumption patterns
